# ./templates

The frontend development directory. Contains static files without any
dependencies. Divided into `src` and `dist`.

`src` holds frontend development files.
If we use SCSS, it should go in here.
This is where JS, fonts, images, and HTML/templates should be.

`dist` holds any 'compiled' frontend files, like the product of SCSS
compillation.
